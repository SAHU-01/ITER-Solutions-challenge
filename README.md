Theme: Food resource management and insecurity 

### What is your Idea?
While the developed and developing nations are trying to achieve the SDGs established by the United Nations,a concrete prototype is necessary for every government or institution dealing with,or related to Food and Hunger.If technology invades to achieve these goals,that would be the best possible solution.When existent food resources and the building financial loses are rising leading to a price hike,what if alternative hidden resources are used?

And thus comes, “Millets” ,with 2023 being announced as the global millet year it’s evident enough that millet has the potential to change the market and demands and show a significant rise in global economy.Now comes the question how to relate millets and technology,firstly,there are only selected areas, to be specific,hilly terrains where their cultivation is possible in abundance,but lack of resources and knowledge forces it’s cultivators to reach the desired market,If a prototype is built via cloud,bot services and correct amount of datasets are produced then data scientists ,ML researchers ,cloud architects,web/app developers could bring a full fledged network into action.

## Problem you're trying to solve?

### Problem you're trying to solve?

There could be various reasons such as cost effectiveness, comparable or improved functionality, promotion of health benefits, a more desirable source from which the ingredient is derived, labeling advantages, ready availability, ease of use, or overall marketability to choose a new dominant food type.And "Millets" can serve all these purposes but despite invading the markets millet due to several natural and technological resons has not beeen able to do the same.

As efficient data analysis and proper on ground working ML Models are not ready for this field ,the desired target can't be achieved,moreover the major sector involved in bringing change i.e.,the farmers are mostly uneducated or deprived of the working pattern,thus,to help both the parties firstly ,an educational platform for regional based training is necessary,secondly,not textual but animated learning is necessary for uneducated folks,moreover recent and translated regional information has to provided from door to door.Proper advertisement stratergies are necessary.And enforcement of a proper analysed data and ML model is required to get target output.

### Why is it important to address this problem?

The global millet market is expected to reach 10060 million by the end of 2027,with one of the highest invetments in coming 2023,thus it can not just help any devloping country struggling with food crisis and after covid economic loses to improve but also help countries achieve their SDG goals set by United Nations within the given time frame.If technology invades and helps the food sector develop then it would be an all new era of computational power that tech giants hold increasing their annual revenues and breaking myths that technology can improve lifestyle but not mankind!

### What made you think of this product?

I had participated in a number of Model United Nation Conferences where I was assigned to pass draft resolutions on SDGs 1 and 2 dealing with No poverty and Zero Hunger ,it was then on reaserach that I found the UN General assembly had announced the year 2023 as global millet year seeing millet as one of the only substitues that could bring a huge economic change as well has deal with the all the SDG goals.I continued researching every country's stand and issues to attain this target but suprisingly the common issue arising in almost all countries was lack of a prototype that could educate the farmers and an effcient model that could promise greater productivity by analysing existent ground data.Thus ,I thought of "Millectos" Basicallly focusing on how to educate farmers and providing them relevant data to get desired production,by building a model first ,then moving towards interactive and informative form of education!

### What is the product purpose?
- Analysing Existent Data
- Creating a Functional Model to maximise production and revenue
- Educating farmers
- Providing them recent and regional information
- Adverstising to get target audiance
- Creating market stratergies guidelines to follow for farmers for increasing their sales
- Achieving SDG goals
- Improving the economic crisis

### Business Objective
- Except government websites,there are hardly any farmer eduvational platforms that provide the relevant data to farmers,moreover they are not built to transmit the same data in various languages thus failing to provide the target audiance the required data,with "**Millectos**" aiming to provide interactive education with regional language support ,this makes the product stand out to not just NGO's working for this sector but also it opens doors for government funding as their dual targets of achieving SDGs and 2023 mileet year are achieved.
- Food is a never ending essential resource thus,if any technology giant invests and builts a prototype,or even accepts **Millectos** and improves it,this would bring them huge revenues because this is not an issue related to one country it's an issue related to every nation ,and for the maintanence purposes this would be an ever lasting project that would help numerous indivisals by providing them job oppurtunities as well
- **Millectos** would change and bring a stir to the food market as well,thus helping achieve a healthier alternative ,increasing revenues for the food manufacturing giants as well.
