Theme: Food resource management and insecurity 

While the developed and developing nations are trying to achieve the SDGs established by the United Nations,a concrete prototype is necessary for every government or institution dealing with,or related to Food and Hunger.If technology invades to achieve these goals,that would be the best possible solution.When existent food resources and the building financial loses are rising leading to a price hike,what if alternative hidden resources are used?

And thus comes, “Millets” ,with 2023 being announced as the global millet year it’s evident enough that millet has the potential to change the market and demands and show a significant rise in global economy.Now comes the question how to relate millets and technology,firstly,there are only selected areas, to be specific,hilly terrains where their cultivation is possible in abundance,but lack of resources and knowledge forces it’s cultivators to reach the desired market,If a prototype is built via cloud,bot services and correct amount of datasets are produced then data scientists ,ML researchers ,cloud architects,web/app developers could bring a full fledged network into action.
